The dataset used for sentiment analysis consists of Amazon product reviews. There are overall 21 columns and 34000 records. The feature column is “reviews.text”, which describes review of the product. The initial step involved loading the dataset using pandas and dropping missing values from the 'reviews.text' column. Each review text was preprocessed using spaCy to create tokens. The preprocessing involved lemmatization to convert words to their base form and removing stopwords, punctuation, and digits from the text. spaCy library was used to load the 'en_core_web_lg' model for natural language processing tasks. A sentiment analysis function was defined to analyze the sentiment of each review text. The function utilizes spaCy's polarity attribute to determine the sentiment polarity of the review.
Reviews with a polarity score greater than or equal to 0.5 are classified as 'Positive', while reviews with a polarity score less than -0.5 are classified as 'Negative'. Reviews with polarity scores between -0.5 and 0.5 are classified as 'Neutral'. The sentiment analysis function was tested on a sample of 20 product reviews from the dataset. For each review, the sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) was predicted based on the polarity score obtained from the spaCy model. The model utilizes advanced NLP techniques provided by spaCy for preprocessing and sentiment analysis. Provides a straightforward approach to categorize reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
The polarity threshold for classification (0.5 and -0.5) might not be optimal for all datasets and might require adjustment based on the specific domain or context. Dependency on spaCy and its pretrained model might result in biases inherited from the training data.
